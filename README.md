Implementation of search agents and search algorithms using UC-Berkeley's Pac-Man Project Template

This was a class project for CS-3600 (Intro to Artificial Intelligence) at Georgia Tech. Working off of the template simulator provided, I implemented methods for using breadth-first, depth-first, uniform cost, and A* search to determine the optimal route through a state space. Files in this project which are edited by me include:
    1) search.py
    2) searchAgents.py
All personal code is marked at the start and end points with comments, and can also be found in the project description file "Project 1.htm"
